FAQ

What is mode?
    mode is a way to switch out the purpose of JENRY, while making the help list small.
    this is totally just a way for me to find something to do and also its still in development so theres not much to it.

IMPORTANT NOTE: you might have to do a single command to check if the updated settings works, as the json load only happens at the start of every loop

what are the planned modes?

    mode 0 > sample modes, having simple commands
    mode 1 > chatbot mode, using machine learning to create a chatbot of jenry
